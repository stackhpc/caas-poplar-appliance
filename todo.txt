make old awx work with my changes:
* (done) review with james the new ssh into bow + classic (and vipu ip)
* (done) reivew floating ip
* restore awx bit, gut make them skip
* restore legacy clouds.yaml when extra_var not set
* fix up optional storage network

next steps:
* option for image uuids, like other appliances
* add wait for zenith service
* remove references to gbnwp_cl1, and groupvars (fix ipum ips?)
* implement auto delete with CRD operator?

* auto get the 10.5.x.x IP from this info:

$ vipu-admin get agent lr75-ipum1 --showjson
{
        "agent": {
                "id": "lr75-ipum1",
                "spec": {
                        "host": "10.2.75.1",
