# This task list is executed when cluster_state = present, which happens during
# new appliance build AND during appliance update. Steps taken are:
#
# 1. Remove an existing user allocation (with same name as this appliance)
#    This is to handle the update case
# 2. We then create the allocation as requested by the user (either new build
#    or update), and we fail if the allocation creation isn't possible due to
#    lack of space. This spins-up the containerized V-IPU for the instance.
# 3. From the allocation properties, we retrieve the IPUM list and shuffle the
#    IPUMs, which requires execution of terraform.
# 4. Create partition, if user requested, in the instance cV-IPU
