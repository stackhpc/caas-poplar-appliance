  This Poplar appliance is configured with {{cluster.outputs.allocation_size}} {{cluster.outputs.ipum_model}} IPUs, {{cluster.outputs.cluster_operating_system}} and flavour {{cluster.outputs.cluster_flavour_name}}. The lifetime is {{cluster.outputs.cluster_lifetime}} hrs, hence automatic deletion is scheduled at {{cluster.outputs.cluster_termination_epoch}}.

  You may access the appliance in a web browser via the [Web console service]({{ webconsole.url }}) and by SSH.  The SSH keys used are those in the Graphcore LDAP service. SSH is configured to allow login only by the appliance creator and Cloud Development engineers. Further users may be enabled by adding them to the `ipupod` group. The web console logs in as user `ipuuser` automatically.

  To connect with SSH, you may copy this command:
  ```
  $ ssh {{ cluster.outputs.cluster_user | default("ubuntu") }}@{{ cluster.outputs.cluster_access_ip | default("[cluster ip]") }}
  ```

  The following environment variables have been set in the appliance:

  ```
  GC_PUBLIC_IP={{cluster.outputs.cluster_access_ip | default("[cluster ip]") }}
  GC_ALLOCATION_NAME={{cluster.outputs.allocation_name}}
  IPUOF_VIPU_API_PARTITION_ID={{cluster.outputs.ipuof_vipu_api_partition_id}}
  IPUOF_VIPU_API_HOST={{cluster.outputs.ipuof_vipu_api_host}}
  ```

  {% if cluster.outputs.allocation_size == 0 -%}
  You may add IPUs to your appliance by selecting the update button at the top of this
  pane. The IPUs will be added, and this VM will be preserved in place.
  {%- endif %}

  A data volume is mounted at `/data`, and content stored there will persist for the lifetime
  of the appliance. Other parts of the filesystem may be affected during a patch operation,
  including any packages that have been installed using `apt`.

  Monitoring dashboards for the appliance are available using the [Monitoring service]({{ monitoring.url }}).
